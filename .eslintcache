In between Baa Ruu Waa Artistry sought to\r\n              present a new typeset with a twist of forms and figures with all\r\n              aligned rifts. Giving birth to a form that is owned, in hues and\r\n              appeal, giving rise to a new garb in esoteric and obviously an\r\n              artistic totem.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <li>\r\n              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baa Ruu Waa Artistry methodologically and\r\n              periodically explores the mood in stages of activities of\r\n              characters, such that an onlooker will find a place empty on stage\r\n              to fill.

I had a group,\r\n              we were a trio, with bond – and that bond is only to draw. At\r\n              home, another group of four. Taking a break from whatever we were\r\n              engaged-in, is just to draw whatever we feel we can’t use words to\r\n              say. Great joy this brought to our hearts. Six years we spent at\r\n              school and at home and all were to disperse, a soul-pal ‘asked me\r\n              what you want to do?’ I replied ‘Become a doctor’ but he tacitly\r\n              corrected me ‘Become an artist’ I thought he meant ill-luck for\r\n              me, I was mad.

Later at the University, I met Chief\r\n              Ibigbami, a pioneer member of the Ori Olokun renaissance, as if I\r\n              was his image in this mirror, he loved me with such a passion that\r\n              I had to expend such energy on my studies and won’t go home during\r\n              holidays but get books from him and the library to read them for\r\n              the next academic session. One day, ‘Baba’, as we used to call\r\n              him, asked me what are you doing, what are you not doing? I knew\r\n              the answer, and that it is left to me.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <li>\r\n              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I am in the future, a professional artist\r\n              and have collected experience over some sixteen years, exhibited\r\n              among the best of Ile-Ife in the year 2003, many exhibitions in\r\n              Nigeria, few abroad and recently completed a two years Artist in\r\n              Residence program in Lagos at the Signature Gallery, at Ikoyi,\r\n              Lagos.
