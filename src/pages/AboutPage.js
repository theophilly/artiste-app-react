          <hr></hr>
          <ul>
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Akinjide Baruwa is a contemporary Nigerian
              artist living and working in Osogbo, Nigeria. He studied art at
              the Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile-Ife and his main medium is
              painting. His studio practice also includes various forms of
              textile dying and drawing on paper.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a process-oriented method Baruwa partly
              produces the pigments for his artwork by himself, based on the use
              of plants as herbal medicine in Yoruba culture. His work brings
              together local forms of artwork and a contemporary approach, based
              on the philosophy of modern African art movements.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artist founded the Baa Ruu Waa Artistry as a
              reaction to the need for a change in society and to adapt the
              local philosophy to the needs of the modern society. Akinjide
              Baruwa has exhibited his work in Nigeria and internationally, his
              work is mentioned in various publications.

          <span>THE BAA RUU WAA ARTISTRY</span>
          <hr></hr>
          <ul>
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Baa Ruu Waa Artistry is a section of the
              Mbari Mbayo Art Movement, that is notable for the revival of the
              mind and a re-dedication to the culture in which one belongs.
              Activities of the Mbari Mbayo can be traced back to the legendary
              ‘Ori Olokun’ renaissance, stirred by activism in the art, in the
              early days of the University of Ile-Ife, now known as Obafemi
              Awolowo University, and Eastern Nigeria, where ‘Uli paintings’ are
              relayed and endure.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baa Ruu Waa Artistry is an obsession and
              obviously a style inspired by the ingenuity inherent in the Mbari
              Mbayo and Osogbo Sacred Art movement pivoted by Ulli Bier.
              Academic artists as against bucolic artist are too parallel to
              meet at any time. In between Baa Ruu Waa Artistry sought to
              present a new typeset with a twist of forms and figures with all
              aligned rifts. Giving birth to a form that is owned, in hues and
              appeal, giving rise to a new garb in esoteric and obviously an
              artistic totem.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baa Ruu Waa Artistry methodologically and
              periodically explores the mood in stages of activities of
              characters, such that an onlooker will find a place empty on stage
              to fill. Moods ranging from nostalgia to revolt are prevalent with
              strokes any could ordinarily make or perceive.

          <span>ARTIST STATEMENT</span>
          <hr></hr>
          <ul>
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Vague memories of visit to an uncle, who
              paints on glass-medium, at an age I could barely remember,
              inspired my curiosity and I asked for one of his works as a gift.
              Hung in our sitting-room, my father would not want to see it,
              tagged it “anti-island”. I would sneak where it was kept by my
              mother and steal a long look.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I started elementary school. I had a group,
              we were a trio, with bond – and that bond is only to draw. At
              home, another group of four. Taking a break from whatever we were
              engaged-in, is just to draw whatever we feel we can’t use words to
              say. Great joy this brought to our hearts. Six years we spent at
              school and at home and all were to disperse, a soul-pal ‘asked me
              what you want to do?’ I replied ‘Become a doctor’ but he tacitly
              corrected me ‘Become an artist’ I thought he meant ill-luck for
              me, I was mad. It sounded like a curse.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in the college, my art teacher would
              come to me to borrow my drawing book to teach the final year
              students, the Chiaroscuro. Later at the University, I met Chief
              Ibigbami, a pioneer member of the Ori Olokun renaissance, as if I
              was his image in this mirror, he loved me with such a passion that
              I had to expend such energy on my studies and won’t go home during
              holidays but get books from him and the library to read them for
              the next academic session. One day, ‘Baba’, as we used to call
              him, asked me what are you doing, what are you not doing? I knew
              the answer, and that it is left to me.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I am in the future, a professional artist
              and have collected experience over some sixteen years, exhibited
              among the best of Ile-Ife in the year 2003, many exhibitions in
              Nigeria, few abroad and recently completed a two years Artist in
              Residence program in Lagos at the Signature Gallery, at Ikoyi,
              Lagos. The experience as an artist in residency is such a song.”
